     * The execution length of this Cloudlet (Unit: in Million Instructions
     * (MI)). According to this length and the power of the processor (in
     * Million Instruction Per Second - MIPS) where the cloudlet will be run,
     * the cloudlet will take a given time to finish processing. For instance,
     * for a cloudlet of 10000 MI running on a processor of 2000 MIPS, the
     * cloudlet will spend 5 seconds using the processor in order to be
     * completed (that may be uninterrupted or not, depending on the scheduling
     * policy).
